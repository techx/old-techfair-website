<h2>Some Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What's the format of the hackathon?</h3>
<p>Anything goes! Web apps, mobile apps, and hardware hacks are all welcome.
(Hacks should be computer-related, though.) Projected will be judged based on
<strong>creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness</strong>.</p>
<h3>I'm not too close to MIT. Can I get reimbursed for travel?</h3>
<p>Sure! Unfortunately, we can only reimburse up to $20 per participant. If
you're looking to be reimbursed, please email us at <a
href="mailto:techfair-hack@mit.edu">techfair-hack@mit.edu</a> to let us know.</p>
<h3>Who can attend?</h3>
<p>All undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. Participants must be
registered through Eventbrite (see above).</p>
<h3>How big should teams be? Can I do it alone?</h3>
<p>Teams should be at most 4 people total. You can do it alone, but it'll be
less fun! We'll have a site up to help find teams before the event, and you'll
have time at the start to meet others.</p>
<h3>Are we allowed to build on past projects? Other code?</h3> <p>We strongly
discourage, but do not forbid, building off of existing projects you've worked
on. If you're building off of existing code you should note that, to be fair to
others. On the other hand, using third-party APIs and libraries is definitely
okay, as long as they're accessible by everyone else as well.</p>
