<h1>Exhibit at TechFair</h1>
<p><strong>MIT TechFair</strong> is a one-day annual technology expo that aims to showcase the world's most innovative tech companies to MIT's best and brightest students. TechFair invites a broad spectrum of companies, from established multinationals to revolutionary new startups, to promote and demonstrate their products to an audience of several thousand MIT students pursuing careers in the industry. Throughout the day, there will be live product demos, tech talks given by distinguished speakers, Q&amp;A sessions, and a best-in-show style awards ceremony.</p>
<p>Our emphasis on product showcase means that we attract only students who are fundamentally competent and passionate about the technologies on display.  Weâ€™ve found that in the past, the companies and students who attend TechFair have greatly impressed each other and thoroughly enjoyed their experiences.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, TechFair has a proud history of partnering with a broad range of loyal sponsors, including Oracle, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Thompson Reuters, Google, and many more.
