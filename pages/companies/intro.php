<h1>Welcome to Techfair!</h1>
<h2>About Techfair: what to expect</h2>
<p><em>Techfair 2013 is scheduled for Feb 4, 2012, the day before classes start, from 10AM-3PM (setup starts at 7AM).</em></p>

<p>Techfair is not your average career fair. Now in its fifth year, Techfair is a new take on how recruiting should look like at MIT. At this Institute, you'll find some of the most passionate and curious minds out there, and you'll find that appealing to their intellectual interests can be one of the most effective ways of persuading a student to join your cause.</p>

<p>Our mission is to bring technology to the recruiting process. We believe that, by bringing tech demos, excitement, and fun to the average career fair we can create an experience that benefits all parties involved.</p>

<p>We're extremely excited to have you and your organization on board - the fair is not too far away, and we have a lot of work to do together!</p>

<h2>Important Deadlines</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Company registration is initiated by an official invoice, sent by your CR liaison.</p>
  <li>1 week after receiving portal login information: company logo, name (as displayed on marketing materials), and description must be submitted to the logistics portal.</li>
  <li>Jan 7: The rest of the logistics portal must be completely filled out. This includes crucial details like A/V requests, the representatives attending, hotel needs, and more. You'll receive more details on hotel and A/V within the next month, as soon as details are settled on our end.</li>
  <li>Jan 21: All shipped packages should be received. We allot extra time so we can notify you of any missing packages and resolve these issues before the fair!</li>
  <li>Jan 31: Payments due (see below for more information).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logistical Portal</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks you will receive your login information for the logistics portal, an online website. This will be the primary means of collecting and aggregating company data.</p>

<h2>Booths</h2>
<p>Company booths are the core of Techfair - they're a reflection of both the company and the fair. Students are looking for interesting and engaging booths with technology demos they can learn about and ideally try out.</p>

<p>We encourage every company to invest time into their Techfair display! We've seen incredible displays from a wide variety of companies. Organizations with tangible products have brought in prototypes of their latest models and designs, while software companies tend to demo their latest (and sometimes unreleased) products on large gorgeous displays. Others with products that are more difficult to demonstrate have instead compiled videos, infographics, and posters on the impact of their work and the science or engineering behind them. Just for fun, we've also seen baristas, popcorn machines, and swag for attendees.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas you want to run by us or any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

<h2>Invoice and Payments</h2>
You'll receive an invoice upon being confirmed for acceptance into the fair. Payment should be completed by January 31st. If you prefer to pay by credit card, let your CR liaison know and we can provide a link to pay online. Otherwise, please send all checks to:<p>

<p>
<strong>MIT Technology Fair</strong>
W20-401
84 Massachusetts Avenue
Cambridge, MA 02139
</p>

<h2>Packages and Shipping</h2>
<p>MIT Mail Services will be receiving and storing packages intended for use at Techfair. To ensure that you receive all of your shipments on the day of the fair, please send your packages to the exact address below (note that it is different from the invoice address):</p>

<p>
<strong>Techfair</strong>
WW15
350 Brookline St.
Cambridge, MA 02139
</p>

<p>Packages mailed must be received at this address by January 21st. We will be taking inventory of the packages soon after this deadline and will notify you of how many of your packages we have received. Because MIT Mail Services receives and sorts a large number of packages a day, mislabeled items have a high chance of not being sorted into Techfair's group of packages. In order to prevent avoidable delays, please be sure your packages are labeled clearly with Techfair and your company's name.</p>

<p>If you are shipping your packages back right after the fair, we will provide you FedEx labels and cover the cost of shipping. We will also include stickers to place on your packages that indicate your packages are to be shipped that day. Please attach both the label and sticker to your packages and leave your packages in front of your booth to be collected.</p>

<p>If you are storing your packages overnight for Tau Beta Pi's career fair, we will provide you stickers that indicate your package is to be stored overnight. Please attach the sticker to the front of your packages and leave your packages in front of your booth to be collected.</p>

<h2>A/V Services</h2>
<p>Based on feedback and past experience, Techfair is simplifying its A/V services to instead offering a selection of a) PC Laptop, b) 32. LCD Monitor, and c) 40. LCD Monitor. Companies can choose any or all of the three, and Techfair will provide them at no extra cost. You can request these items through the logistics portal in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><em>(These do cost us $150, $150, and $200 respectively to rent from MIT A/V services, however, so we kindly ask that companies only request items as necessary!)</em></p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Feel free to contact us with any questions or comments. Your corporate relations (CR) liaison is always available to answer any questions, or you can reach us at techfair-cr@mit.edu and techfair-exec@mit.edu.</p>
