<h1>For Companies</h1>
<h2>Exhibit at Techfair</h2>
<p><strong>Techfair</strong> is a one-day annual technology expo that aims to showcase the world's most innovative tech companies, research labs and student projects to MIT's best and brightest students. Techfair invites a broad spectrum of companies, from established multinationals to revolutionary new startups, to promote and demonstrate their products to an audience of several thousand MIT students interested in technology.</p>
<h2>Banquet</h2>
<p>Another benefit of Techfair sponsorship is the post-fair banquet, a formal dinner where companies will be able to invite <strong>students of their choice</strong> to their reserved table. This is an excellent opportunity for sponsors to connect to MIT students on a different level.</p>
