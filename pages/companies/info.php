    <h1 id="welcome">Welcome to Techfair!</h1>
    <h2>About Techfair: what to expect</h2>
    <p><em>Techfair 2013 is scheduled for <strong>Feb 4, 2013</strong>, the day
    before classes start, from <strong>10AM-3PM</strong> (setup starts at
    <strong>7AM</strong>).</em></p>

    <p>Techfair is not your average career fair. Now in its fifth year, Techfair is
    a new take on how recruiting should look like at MIT. At this Institute, you'll
    find some of the most passionate and curious minds out there, and you'll find
    that appealing to their intellectual interests can be one of the most effective
    ways of persuading a student to join your cause.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to bring technology to the recruiting process. We believe
    that, by bringing tech demos, excitement, and fun to the average career fair we
    can create an experience that benefits all parties involved.</p>

    <p>We're extremely excited to have you and your organization on board - the
    fair is not too far away, and we have a lot of work to do together!</p>

    <h2 id="deadlines">Important Deadlines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Company registration is initiated by an official invoice, sent by your CR liaison.</li>
      <li><strong>1 week after receiving portal login information:</strong> company logo, name (as displayed on marketing materials), and description must be submitted to the logistics portal.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 11:</strong> The rest of the logistics portal must be completely filled out. This includes crucial details like A/V requests, the representatives attending, hotel needs, and more. You'll receive more details on hotel and A/V within the next month, as soon as details are settled on our end. (NB: The original deadline was January 7, and has been moved back to January 11.)</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 21:</strong> All shipped packages should be received. We allot extra time so we can notify you of any missing packages and resolve these issues before the fair!</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 31:</strong> Payments due (see below for more information).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="logistics-portal">Logistics Portal</h2>
    <p>You can access the logistics portal at <a
    href="http://techfair.mit.edu/portal">http://techfair.mit.edu/portal</a>. The
    portal will be the primary means of collecting and aggregating company data.
    For logistical purposes, it is <strong>essential</strong> that all required
    details are filled out in time.</p>

    <p>Please add your company logo, display name, and description within one week of invoicing. 
    We’ll need this information for marketing materials and for the booths themselves, so it’s 
    important that we get it as early as possible.</p>

    <p>The remaining sections of the portal need to be filled out by
    <strong>January 11</strong> so that we can secure all parking spots, hotel
    rooms, etc in time. If you have any extenuating circumstances and won’t be able
    to complete the portal in time, please let your CR liaison know.</p>

    <h2 id="booths">Booths</h2>
    <p>Company booths are the core of Techfair - they're a reflection of both the
    company and the fair. Students are looking for interesting and engaging booths
    with technology demos they can learn about and ideally try out.</p>

    <p><strong>We encourage every company to invest time into their Techfair
    display!</strong> We've seen incredible displays from a wide variety of
    companies. Organizations with tangible products have brought in prototypes of
    their latest models and designs, while software companies tend to demo their
    latest (and sometimes unreleased) products on large gorgeous displays. Others
    with products that are more difficult to demonstrate have instead compiled
    videos, infographics, and posters on the impact of their work and the science
    or engineering behind them.  Just for fun, we've also seen baristas, popcorn
    machines, and swag for attendees.</p>

    <p class="new-info">Each booth measures 8' x 10' and includes one 6' x 2'
    table, two chairs, and electrical outlets. Free wi-fi is avilable through MIT's
    guest network.</p>

    <p>If you have any ideas you want to run by us or any questions, don't hesitate
    to reach out.</p>

    <h2 id="invoice-payments">Invoice and Payments</h2>
    <p>You'll receive an invoice upon being confirmed for acceptance into the fair.
    Payment should be completed by January 31st. If you prefer to pay by credit
    card, let your CR liaison know and we can provide a link to pay online.
    Otherwise, please send all checks to:</p>

    <p>
    <strong>MIT Technology Fair</strong><br />
    W20-401<br />
    84 Massachusetts Avenue<br />
    Cambridge, MA 02139
    </p>

    <h2 id="packages-shipping">Packages and Shipping</h2>
    <p>MIT Mail Services will be receiving and storing packages intended for use at
    Techfair. To ensure that you receive all of your shipments on the day of the
    fair, please send your packages to the exact address below (note that it is
    different from the invoice address):</p>

    <p>
    <strong>Techfair</strong><br />
    WW15<br />
    350 Brookline St.<br />
    Cambridge, MA 02139
    </p>

    <p><strong>Packages mailed must be received at this address by January
    21st.</strong> We will be taking inventory of the packages soon after this
    deadline and will notify you of how many of your packages we have received.
    Because MIT Mail Services receives and sorts a large number of packages a day,
    mislabeled items have a high chance of not being sorted into Techfair's group
    of packages. In order to prevent avoidable delays, please be sure your packages
    are labeled clearly with Techfair and your company's name.</p>

    <p>If you are shipping your packages back right after the fair, we will provide
    you FedEx labels and cover the cost of shipping. We will also include stickers
    to place on your packages that indicate your packages are to be shipped that
    day. Please attach both the label and sticker to your packages and leave your
    packages in front of your booth to be collected.</p>

    <p>If you are storing your packages overnight for Tau Beta Pi's career fair, we
    will provide you stickers that indicate your package is to be stored overnight.
    Please attach the sticker to the front of your packages and leave your packages
    in front of your booth to be collected. <strong>Please indicate in the
    logistics portal that you are storing things overnight for TBP.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="av">A/V Services</h2>
    <p>Based on feedback and past experience, Techfair is simplifying its A/V
    services to instead offering a selection of a) PC Laptop, b) 32” LCD Monitor,
    and c) 40” LCD Monitor. Companies can choose any or all of the three, and
    Techfair will provide them at no extra cost. You can request these items
    through the logistics portal.</p>

    <p><em>(These do cost us $150, $150, and $200 respectively to rent from MIT A/V
    services, however, so we kindly ask that companies only request items as
    necessary!)</em></p>

    <h2 id="parking" class="new-info">Parking</h2>
    <p>For gold and silver sponsors, complimentary parking will be provided at the
    <strong>Westgate Lot</strong> (located at the end of Amherst Alley in front of
    Next House at 500 Memorial Drive). Notify the parking attendant that you are
    attending Techfair for access to the lot. Gold sponsors will have guaranteed
    spaces, while silver sponsors will receive spaces on a first come first serve
    basis.</p>

    <p><strong>To help with our planning, please indicate the number of parking
    spaces you would like in the logistics portal.</strong></p>

    <p>For sponsors without complimentary parking, there is a pay-per-hour parking lot
    at the corner of Vassar St. and Massachusetts Ave.</p>

    <h2 id="hotels" class="new-info">Hotels</h2>
    <p>For sponsors with hotel accommodations through Techfair, Techfair has booked
    hotel rooms at Le Méridien Cambridge:</p>

    <p>
    <strong>Le Méridien Cambridge</strong><br />
    20 Sidney Street<br />
    Cambridge, MA 02139<br />
    Phone: (617) 577-0200<br />
    Toll-free: (800) 222-8733
    </p>

    <p>Gold sponsors have up to two complimentary rooms, and silver sponsors will
    have one complimentary room. <strong>You must indicate in the logistics portal
    how many rooms you would like.</strong> Rooms will be booked for two nights:
    Sunday, February 3rd and Monday, February 4th. Confirm with your Techfair
    liaison if you have requested additional rooms.</p>

    <p>Check-in details will be available by January 31st.</p>

    <h2 id="banquet" class="new-info">Banquet</h2>
    <p>Platinum, gold, and silver sponsors get tables at the Techfair banquet. The
    banquet is an excellent opportunity for sponsors to connect with students of
    interest. <strong>You must indicate in the logistics portal that you are
    attending the banquet in order to have a table reserved for you.</strong></p>

    <p>The banquet is scheduled from <strong>6-8pm after the fair</strong>
    (February 4) at the <strong>Marriott in Kendall</strong> (Two Cambridge Center,
    50 Broadway Cambridge, Massachusetts, MA 02142). Attire is dressy casual.

    <h3>Banquet Invitation procedure</h3>
    <p>Each banquet table seats 10 people, and companies will be able to invite
    students to sit at their table. Note that the 10 people includes both company
    representatives and students, so if you have 3 representatives attending
    banquet only 7 students can attend. (Please fill out the food choice of the
    representatives in the portal.)</p>

    <p>Shortly after the resume drop opens (mid January), companies will be able to
    invite students through an online system.  More information on how to access
    the system will be released, alongside instructions on accessing the resume
    drop, when the resume drop opens. Students invited prior to the fair will be
    notified via email.</p>

    <p>Additionally, companies will be able to invite students throughout the day of
    the fair by collecting their MIT username and phone number. Students will be
    notified via text message as well as email. All invitations must be accepted by
    3pm the day of the fair.</p>

    <p>The first ten students to accept the invitation will be guaranteed spots at the
    banquet. Companies are allowed to extend as many invitations as they want, but
    any extra students will be placed on a waitlist in case of last minute
    cancellations.</p>

    <p>Finally, Techfair will maintain a general waitlist for students who are
    interested but have not yet received an invitation. We will do our best to
    match students to company tables for those tables with available seats and an
    empty waitlist.</p>

    <h2>Further Updates</h2>
    <p>We will be contacting you in the weeks to come with updates, where
    applicable, regarding any missing details. We will be updating the logistics
    portal to collect any additional information we may need from you.</p>

    relations (CR) liaison is always available to answer any questions, or you can
