<h2>Our Vision for Technology</h2>
<p>We at Techfair believe that innovative technology does not solely stem from a corporate or research setting. That is why, for the first time in Techfair history, we are opening up our booths to include individual student projects , student startups, and student groups on campus. Don't have a project? Come to the <a href="/events">fair</a> and support your friends!</p>
