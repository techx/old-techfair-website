We are looking for projects with a solid plan and people who are determined to complete their project during Fall 2011/IAP 2012. At your interview, we will want you to pitch your project in person and demonstrate that you have considered many of the project's details. Of course, we understand that projects can take unexpected turns. You will have an opportunity to update your budget and revise your plans at check-in #1. Bring any technical plans, documentation, and evidence supporting your project. Interest in displaying your project at Techfair 2012 is also a plus.</li>
