<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Techfair is completely <strong>student-run</strong>, led by passionate and dedicated students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Members of the board are split into six committees: Corporate relations, 
Marketing, Student Relations, Finance, Developer Operations, and Logistics, and two inter-committees: TechTalks 
and Events. We are also affiliated with <a href="http://mittechfair.org/think/">THINK</a>, 
a high school science and technology competition spun out of Techfair in 2008.</p>
